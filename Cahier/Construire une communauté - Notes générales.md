**How To Build Community w/Tom Ross**
- **200 people is the critical mass** for the community to start growing by itself
    
    - before, it’s only the job of the founder to be super-active and make sure
    - Without the founder in it, it’s gonna die
    
    ⇒ One technique is to have a waitlist (and make sure there are 200 people before launch) ; make sure with an _interviewing_ process that they will engage
    
- “You can use your community, or you can serve them”
    - Respond to everyone !
